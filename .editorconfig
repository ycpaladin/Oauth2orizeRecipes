# EditorConfig is from: http://EditorConfig.org
# EditorConfig helps developers define and maintain consistent coding styles between different editors and IDEs.
# The EditorConfig project consists of a file format for defining coding styles and a collection of text editor plugins
# that enable editors to read the file format and adhere to defined styles. EditorConfig files are easily readable and
# they work nicely with version control systems.
